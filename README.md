# React Native Styled Components

This project is a collection of styled components, built into the Expo tabs template.

The theory behind this repo is you can copy and paste the components in the `src/components/ui` folder and use them in your project.

The components are built with the following principles:

- Use the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme (light or dark)
- Use the `Theme` object to get the current theme values. You can treat this like a global.css file.

## Roadmap

Haven't got this far yet !

## Components

- [x] Button
- [x] Text
- [x] View
- [x] TextInput
- [x] Card

More to come!

## Open Source?

I will eventually open this repo up to pull requests but I am having fun building out the components and will continue to do so myself for the immediate future.
